# COVID-19 Data Exploration using SQL

This project explores and analyzes global COVID-19 data using SQL to understand infection rates, death trends, and vaccination progress across countries and continents.

## Objective
To extract meaningful insights from COVID-19 datasets using SQL queries and showcase practical data analysis skills.

## Skills Used
- Joins  
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)  
- Temporary Tables  
- Window Functions  
- Aggregate Functions  
- Creating Views  
- Data Type Conversions  

## Datasets Used
- `CovidDeaths`  
- `CovidVaccinations`

## Key Analysis Performed
- Total Cases vs Total Deaths (Death Percentage)
- Total Cases vs Population (Infection Rate)
- Countries with Highest Infection Rate
- Countries with Highest Death Count
- Continent-wise Death Analysis
- Global COVID-19 Statistics
- Population vs Vaccination Progress
- Rolling Vaccination Count using Window Functions
- Vaccination Percentage using:
  - CTE
  - Temporary Table
  - View for future visualization

## Output
- Calculated death percentages and infection rates  
- Identified most affected countries and continents  
- Tracked vaccination progress over time  
- Created a reusable SQL View for visualization tools  

## How to Run
1. Import the datasets into your SQL database.
2. Run the script file:  
   `COVID Portfolio Project - Data Exploration.sql`
3. Execute queries step by step to view results.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Strong SQL querying
- Data exploration
- Analytical thinking
- Real-world dataset handling
- Portfolio-level project structuring

This project is part of my SQL portfolio to demonstrate my readiness for Data Analyst and MIS Executive roles.
